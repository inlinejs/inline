## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```txt
/
├── packages/
│   ├── inline-config/
│   │   ├── src/
│   │   └── index.ts
│   ├── inline-tokens/
│   │   ├── src/
│   │   └── index.ts
├── public/
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── Card.astro
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── Layout.astro
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

Any primary Web Component and helper packages intended for publishing to the NPM package repository, and utilized by consumer applications.
